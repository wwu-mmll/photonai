        Parameters
        ----------
        cv_strategy
            Strategy for generating train/test sets.

        X: ndarray
            Data X to split.

        y: ndarray
            Targets to split.

        kwargs: dict
            Mostly empty. Responds only to the keyword "groups"
            and returns the corresponding value in the cv_strategy.

            Defines the percentage size of the test set.

        Notes
        -----
        - If there is a strategy given for the outer cross validation the strategy is called to split the data
            - additionally, if a group variable and a GroupCV is passed, split data according to groups.
            - if a group variable and a StratifiedCV is passed, split data according to groups and ignore targets when
            stratifying the data.
            - if no group variable but a StratifiedCV is passed, split data according to targets.
        - If no strategy is given and eval_final_performance is True, all data is used for training.
        - If no strategy is given and eval_final_performance is False: a test set is seperated from the
          training and validation set by the parameter test_size with ShuffleSplit.
